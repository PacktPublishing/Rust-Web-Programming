## Setup 

In order to run the code in this github, you're going to have to install Rust via the following link:

```
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
```

## Running Code 

The code has to be compiled. In order to do this, we navigate to the file we want to run. For this example, we're using ```strings.rs``` in chapter_one. Once we've navigated there, we compile the file using the ```rustc``` command:

```
rustc strings.rs 
```

On Windows, we then run the exe file:

```
.\strings.exe
```

For Linux and Mac, we run using the following:

```
./strings
```
